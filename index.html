  <span class="type" style="--n:5000">I woke up to find another boy sitting in my bed<br>
  Wings sprouted from his back, not like an angel, but a bird<br>
  I felt the judgment in his eyes weighing down on me<br>
I couldn’t bear to look him in the face<br>
Because I was too ashamed<br>
Ashamed of what I’d become<br>
<br>
He was there last night too, watching me intently<br>
Thinking back to the night before,<br>
I couldn’t believe what I had done,<br>
And neither could he<br>
<br>
In the silence of the early morning<br>
There I laid with a weapon of my own making<br>
It was then that I realized<br>
Anything can transform into one<br>
<br>
It was my first time<br>
<br>
Even though I tried to stay as quiet as possible<br>
He must be here because I caught his attention<br>
<br>
It felt like there was something caught in my throat<br>
Or maybe it was in my heart instead<br>
Neither of us spoke a single word,<br>
but I knew what he was thinking<br>
The boy was waiting for something to happen<br>
He was hungry<br>
<br>
Perhaps he’ll return again tonight<br><br>
